## Loan Prediction Module

## Overview
The application of machine learning models in loan approval predictions is a prominent example of using classification modeling within the loan application process. Classification models are capable of learning patterns from historical data (ground truth) to forecast the outcomes of new loan applications. By automating the decision-making process, these models facilitate faster, data-driven decisions, determining whether a credit or loan applicant should be approved or declined based on various features.

In this project, a loan approval classification model is developed to assess a credit or loan applicantâ€™s ability and willingness to repay a loan. Once the applicant's information is entered, the model automatically approves or declines the application, thereby accelerating the loan underwriting process.
